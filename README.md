# Feedback-Analyzer
This project is a feedback analyzer application developed in Python with a Tkinter-based interface. It allows users to input feedback for a list of products, which is then analyzed as negative or positive using a Hugging Face feedback analysis model. The application saves and maintains feedback across sessions, ensuring data persistence. An admin login option is included, enabling the admin to view detailed feedback and generate visual reports such as pie and bar charts using Matplotlib. Admin credentials are securely stored in a file. This project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing, data visualization, and user interface design.
